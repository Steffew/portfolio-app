# Portfolio App with Docker

This is a full-stack portfolio application containerized using Docker, making it easy to run the entire stack with just a single command. It features a **SvelteKit** frontend, a **Node.js** backend, and a **MongoDB** database. Designed with flexibility in mind, it uses dynamic slugs for content handling and can be easily customized or expanded for personal projects, portfolios, or creative showcases.
